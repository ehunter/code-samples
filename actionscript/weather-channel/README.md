The Webbook Weather App
============

The Webbook was the 1st cloud connected laptop. I worked on the team that built the various flash channels (i.e apps) available on the device. 

The Weather app is powered by WeatherBug's API and has features one would expect from a weather app. 7 Day Forecast, Worlwide city lookup (with assistive search), ability to save cities to a list and immersive weather animations and transitions.
