I know, Flash is dead
============

But, I learned a lot about writing good clean object-oriented
code in Actionscript so here are a couple of projects I worked on
at Litl for the [Webbook](http://litl.com/meet-webbook/overview.htm) and [Connected TV](http://www.fastcompany.com/1646754/litl-unveils-internet-interface-aimed-surfers-both-web-and-couch). Hopefully these projects give you some
insight into how I structure large projects. 

These projects are called 'channels' but that was just the
Litl's way of trying to differentiate themselves from apps.
Really they're just apps that run in a chromeless browser
window within a custom version of the Flash player.
