The Webbook Media Player
============

The Webbook was the 1st cloud connected laptop. I worked on the team that built the various flash channels (i.e apps) available on the device. 

I was solely responsible for building and maintaining this app for PBS, Discovery and NPR networks. This one code base deployed to over 75 different video apps in our app store. It makes use of multiple networks API's using one common code base. The video player itself is built off of the Open Source Media Framework.
