Hello!
============

###Thanks for taking the time to look at my code.  

This repo contains various code samples that should give you some insight
into my skillset as a developer.

I've been writing in Objective-C the past two years and before that did
web development, mainly in Actionscript. I'm currently a software engineer
at Litl in Boston. I work on the iOS team with 3 other engineers. We work in the
scrum style of agile development. We have a strict code review policy and adhere
to common coding standards and style.


I think of myself as a coder and designer. I like to go back and forth. My strength
lies in a deep understanding of both the design and the technology fields.

My design and animation work can be seen [here](http://erik-hunter.com/)

###Personal

I currently live in Boston, MA with my wife, daughter and 2 dogs. I was born and raised in
Tulsa, OK. I lived in San Francisco for 5 years before moving to Boston.

My wife and I are [beekeepers](http://dev.woven.by/fNgJxTHQH2/) and my current side project is attaching sensors to our hives (weight,
temp, humidity and hopefully motion) via a raspberry pi and some xBee radios. I'll send that data
to a server (cosm) and then display it client side on a website. If all goes well I'll be able
to tell how much honey our hives are producing without having to open them up, which means I'll
get stung less!
