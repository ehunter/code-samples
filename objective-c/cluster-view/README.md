ClusterImageView
============

This is a custom view for laying out images in a 'brick' style. The below images will help explain the layout. It can handle anywhere from 1-6 images and is built to layout within the view's frame. Meaning it can be used for any screen resolution. This is code I wrote specifically for the app I currently work on called Woven.
