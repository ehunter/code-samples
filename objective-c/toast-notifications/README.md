Custom Toast Notifications
============

This is a custom UIView for displaying notifications on iOS. There are 6 types of notifications available using this class:

       Toast - auto show and hide message that's shown for a specified amount of time. 
       Progress - displays a progress spinner and a message.
       Left Arrow - Typically a hint pointing something on the left side of the screen.
       Right Arrow - Typically a hint pointing something on the right side of the screen.
       Bottom Arrow - Typically a hint pointing something on the bottom part of the screen.
       Top Arrow - Typically a hint pointing something on the top part of the screen.
       

This is code I wrote specifically for the app I currently work on called Woven.

The below images are how the various notifications look.
