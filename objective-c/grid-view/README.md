Grid View
============

This is a custom UICollectionView for laying out items in a grid. The grid breaks down like so:

       iPad - Portait 3 x 4 : Landscape 4 x 3
       iPhone <= 4 - Portait 2 x 3 : Landscape 3 x 2
       iPhone 5 aka longPhone - Portrait 2 x 4 : Landscape 4 x 2
       Landscape is always Portrait ratio flipped

This is code I wrote specifically for the app I currently work on called Woven.

The below images are how the grid looks on various devices.
