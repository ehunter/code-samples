Super simple html page
============

This is a small HTML template with inline CSS I recently wrote that allows users of Woven on iOS to embed a photo in an email when sharing them from the iOS app. This is a dead simple example of HTML, but I don't do much HTML these days so I wanted to at least show something that demonstrates a working knowledge.

The "%@" strings are what get replaced with dynamic strings at runtime in Objective-C.
